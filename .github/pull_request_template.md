1. Aim for enough detail in PR description for things to go smoothly
2. After requested changes, [re-request a review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#re-requesting-a-review) (so the PR shows up in [reviews-requested:@me](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Aupdated-desc+review-requested%3A%40me+))
